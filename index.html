After launching fashion e-commerce back in early 2000, yoox.com has been completely reinvented and redesigned. As part of its new look, it introduces <b>Speak & Shop</b>&trade;, a revolutionary feature for online fashion where text search meets voice recognition from YOOX Group Technology and R&D divisions - innovation Made in Italy.
                    <br>Millions of visitors from around the globe are welcomed to the NEW yoox.com by its digital cover featuring the famous Chinese top model <b>Xiao Wen Ju</b> wearing a video-dress conceived by mixing fashion with technology.</div>
                <div class="col-sm-5">Style and design lovers can search their favorite outfit, shoes, accessories or design objects by simply clicking or writing their favorite color of the season, or by using the feature <b>Speak & Shop</b>&trade; allowing them to state their preferred color in <b>nine languages</b> (British English, Italian, French, Russian, Spanish, German, US English, Japanese and Korean): the digital cover page will return an edited selection of fashion and design pieces in the desired color.

                <div class="col-sm-2">LE CYCLOPE ARDENT - THE SOFTNESS OF CERAMICS AND THE RICHNESS OF PRECIOUS METALS</div>
                <div class="col-sm-5">Cutting-edge French design brand Moustache joins forces with the leading virtual store for multi-brand fashion and design in the world, yoox.com, to create an exciting new product - <b>Le Cyclope Ardent</b>, available exclusively on yoox.com from the end of March 2012.
                    <br>The Cyclope mirror, designed by young French designer <b>Ionna Vautrin</b>, gets its name from the convex mirrors, (which in French are called 'witches' eyes) - Vautrin takes this magical object and perches it atop a soft cone crafted from clay, creating a table-top mirror with a distinctly sculptural feel, evoking the mysterious monolithic statues of far-off primitive cultures or the minimal eloquence of sculptors like Brancusi and Moore.</div>
                <div class="col-sm-5">Originally available in a matt ceramic finish, for yoox.com, Vautrin has created 3 new and unique new versions - Le Cyclope Ardent. Le Cyclope Ardent is coated in a lustrous hi-gloss metallic finish, 3 different metals chosen for their evocative richness, luster and sophistication: opulent gold, elegant platinum and warm, alluring copper. Like a sculpture for the home, Le Cyclope Ardent sits atop any table or desk and gazes out at the world around it, offering users a glimpse into a strange and intriguing vision of the world.</div>
